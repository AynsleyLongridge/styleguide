     <h2>Monogram to Visual Marque</h2>
    <img src="images/monog.png" style="margin-top:40px">
    <p> The brand steams from my monogram, the encorperation of my initials ( AL ) interwoven together to create a seamless line. The initials are combined in a way that was subtle and minimalistic creating the core of the brand. From the monogram we can then see how the visual marque was devised through duplicating and connecting. The idea behind the marque is a lightening bolt, representing a striking brand.

<section><h2>Colour Scheme</h2>
    <p>The colour scheme is based around Prussian Blue, Cinnabar and Madang. The prussian blue acts as a blackdrop under the cinnabar and madang to highlight key areas and touchpoints. The Cinnabar will be used as the heading and body font colour and background to buttons. </p>
